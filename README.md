# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio

## A bit about me...
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EnjoyRealTea - **E**. **R**. **T**hompson - and I do enjoy a cup of tea. And reality!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much about Data Science as I can, and am aiming for a career in data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python on a Data Science course.
- âš¡ Fun fact:  Modern medicine has given me the chance to take my life back and I'm not going to waste that opportunity!


## About the Portfolio

This porfolio was started at the beginning of my Python journey in Data Science with Hyperion Dev.
Along with the Capstone tasks required of the course, there are various case studies and smaller coding examples showcasing the skills I have gained over the course.
